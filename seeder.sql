Just because you know you aren\'t anorexic or bulimic doesn\'t mean that you don\'t handle an ED; there are lots of more ED\'s out there than just anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. For example, anorexia nervosa is only one type of anorexia; there is also Atypical Anorexia, which happens when the person with the ED has either a healthy or overweight BMI. When I was in your shoes, NEDA\'s resources really helped me. Since you\'ve mentioned that you\'re worried if you could have an ED, but your not sure what ED, or if it could just be disordered eating, this link may be helpful: nationaleatingdisorders.org/information-eating-disorder. I hope you feel better!\n\nEdit: Spelling','2018-11-19 11:09:26',_binary '\0',5,9),(16,'Well how important is it actually knowing whether you have an eating disorder or not?\n\nIf you are happy with how you eat and a medical pro says you have an eating disorder, versus being unhappy with how you eat and a medical pro saying you are fine.\n\nWhich situation is \"worse\"? I know we need clear definitions and these are medical conditions but i know i have an eating disorder and ive never been diagnosed. Eating 8k caloriea in one sitting, hating myself for it only to do it again the next day, yea i have an eating disorder regardless of what a doctor says.','2018-11-19 11:09:43',_binary '\0',5,8),(17,'It\'s very important! ED\'s are mental illnesses, and among that, they are the deadliest mental illnesses.\n\nA lot of times people with ED\'s can think the way they eat is \"normal\" for their body. Thinking, \"I\'m different than everyone else; I don\'t need x amount of calories,\" or, \"eating x amount of calories in one sitting is okay for me,\" even if that x amount of calories is way too little (anorexia symptoms), or way too large (binge-eating disorder sypmtoms).\n\nLike I said, ED\'s are mental illnesses. The illness itself isn\'t in your stomach or lungs, but rather in your brain. You can\'t pin point the ED\'s exact spot in your brain with a microscope. That\'s why when you see a mental health or otherwise medical professional, they can\'t just do a brain scan and say, \"oh, look, I found it! There\'s the ED! It\'s in the (insert brain part here)!\" Rather, ED\'s function similar to anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. It\'s a chemical im*****ce in your brain. That\'s what makes ED\'s and mental illnesses in general so complex.\n\nED\'s screw up your mind and way of thinking. It\'s why a lot of people who go through ED\'s wait until the last minute to reach out for professional help, or even just reaching out to someone. They never think that they\'re sick \"enough.\"\n\nSince ED\'s screw up your mind and way of thinking, it\'s easy for reality to get distorted. Your brain can get tricked into feeling happy when you follow your ED\'s behaviors.\n\nED\'s are a lot like addictions, which is another type of a real and serious mental illness. Instead of becoming addicted to a substance, people with ED\'s become addicted to their ED, whether that\'s restricting food, exercising excessively, abusing laxatives, purging, binging, you get the idea.\n\nSo, to answer your question, it\'s extremely vital to reach out for help before the issue progresses and spirals out of control. The earlier you get help, the more positive attitude toward recovery you\'ll be able to develop, which will increase your chances of full recovery and an ED-free life.\n\nWe shouldn\'t put much thought into food. If you are falling into that trap of disordered thinking, whether that\'s developing an ED and being \"happy,\" or being unhappy with a healthy amount of food, you need to reach out for help. Neither of those situations are \"worse\"; it just all depends on the context.\n\nIf a doctor says that you don\'t have an ED or they dismiss disordered behaviors as \"normal,\" see an ED specialist. All doctors have a general knowledge of ED\'s, but ED specialists are specifically trained to help with ED\'s. Even if your doctor is more trained than most with ED\'s, it may be helpful to ask about getting a referral to see a specialist for the best help that you can get.

I wish we would have done that more because you’re interacting with each other, unlike when you’re watching tv or a movie, and it’s not centered around eating. Finding ways to bond without food being present (like at all) would help her a lot. Personally, I get anxious spending time with my family because I know that the event will be centered around food. It ****s, and I just want to spend time with them without having to worry about eating.\n\nI hope I gave you some good advice. It’s going to be really frustrating seeing your daughter go through this. It’s really hard for people without eating disorders to understand people with eating disorders.

You’re a good parent for that alone and I know that will mean the world to her. I struggled with bulimia for six years. I opened up to my mom about it after her asking several times. At the time, my disabled little sister was battling leukemia and I wanted to be a better role model for her. Not only that but it was killing me and my mom knew something was terribly wrong. My hair was falling out, I couldn’t keep any food down, and it physically hurt me to get out of bed since I was so dehydrated and depleted of electrolytes. She stressed the importance of getting help and was really supportive. Everyone with an ED knows they need help at some level, and it helps when a family member stresses that. Ask her what you can do in the meantime, my mom simply asked me “what can I do to make you feel better right now?” For me, mine stemmed from my anxiety and past experiences I had. You can only go to therapy once or twice a week, it’s really about making everyday better. Sometimes it’s just about going to a movie and keeping her mind off of things. If she has any interests that she wants to pursue, make time in her schedule to focus on things that keep her happy (music, dancing, etc.). Focus on self-care for her, like bath bombs and face masks. Skincare became HUGE in my recovery since it was physical stimuli. My mom just holding my hand through it and focusing on the little things really helped me through it. In terms of normalizing and having a healthy relationship with food, eating mostly vegan really helped me because I was proud of what I was putting in my body since I knew it made a positive impact on the environment and I never felt bloated or gross after, even if it was dairy free Ben & Jerry’s. I started cycling and getting fresh air and that helped too. But everyone is different, find out what she loves and envelop her in that. And when she wants to talk, give her a hug and tell her that you’re proud of her. Focus on positive reinforcement. ED recovery takes a long time, it’s like addiction. Congratulate her on the baby steps and make everyday something to be happy about. Props to you though, you’re doing the right thing as a parent and I’m proud of you and I know she will be too!

Ramen with a fried egg thrown in is actually pretty good BTW. And a tub of off-brand butter is all you need for some frying. Work your way up to cheap bread and off-brand sandwich meat. Peanut butter can be a little pricey but think of all the sandwiches you can get out of one jar! Worth!\n\nYou might try budgeting every pay period so you know exactly how much money you have. Make sure you don\'t go over your budget and find good deals! I find that, while spending money isn\'t a good feeling, getting a great deal on something is awesome! The other day I got some olive oil mayo for just over a dollar! Pretty damn delicious and seems to be a bit healthier than regular mayo.\n\nSome things at the grocery store are just too damn expensive (I\'m looking at you bacon). And if you aren\'t comfortable in paying for it, don\'t get it. There are cheap ways to get the nutrients you need. I get Poptarts because one, I love them and two, cereal is expensive and cuts the roof of my mouth. You won\'t hurt me twice, cereal! As for bacon, I love it but I rarely get it. It\'s pricey and doesn\'t keep long.\n\nThat\'s something else you can keep in mind! Get canned soups and veggies because they keep longer and you won\'t feel bad if you don\'t eat it right away (I hate wasting food more than spending money to be honest).\n\nI hope this is helpful. Sorry for the long comment.\n\n','2018-11-19 11:30:42',_binary '\0',10,7),(47,'I used to get really bad financial anxiety. I\'ve easily read hundreds of articles on the topic and at least a few books. Groceries are probably my biggest expense. Not going to the grocery store is definitely a way to save, but you need food to live. Go with a list and a calculator if you\'re on a really tight budget. Meal planning will help. If you want foods that are not parishable just Google pantry recipes or something similar. I\'ve used pepperplate to collect recipes and meal plan. It\'ll even make a grocery list for you. Or you could Google pre-made meal plans. Keep in mind: the more prepackaged you buy the more expensive.

I plan to start getting healthier food once I start making more money, but for now I have that to keep me from going hungry. I hope that you are able to figure something out, another thing you might try is talking to your roommate about splitting the cost of groceries and which would save you money and possibly make it so that you wouldn\'t have to shop as they could do the shopping and you could pay them.

It’s really important when battling any kind of anxiety that you are managing your overall health and well-being, or else the battle to fight off overwhelming anxiety becomes exponentially more difficult.

That, to me, is why you want the situation to be perfect. The best remedy is to keep eating often, and never, ever miss meals or your meal plan if you have one. If you are undereating, your body is still thinking it needs to protect whatever it can get, so your brain reads this as \"do not let anyone/thing get in the way of this!\".\n\nJust keep eating your nourishing meals per the refeeding plan, and remember: you are going to eat again in a short while.

Honestly it just took time and food and some weight gain and it has mostly gone away. The need to ritualize and make sacred the food is a part of malnourishment and the refeeding is bringing that to the forefront. Also after awhile life will start to get in the way of those rituals rather than them getting in the way of life. I wish you the best of luck! Feel free to pm if you ever need support.\n\n','2018-11-19 11:35:44',_binary '\0',12,6),(56,'I totally feel you OP! My whole life I\'ve been a perfectionist and ritual and routine was everything to me. In the six years that I\'ve been going in and out of recovery with this ED, it has sometimes been the only thing holding me together. I still hold onto that part of me, but because it can help with efficiency and flow in daily living, not because I need it for everything to be okay.\n\nThe biggest turning point for me, was to realise that none of it matters, and that came during inpatient when I looked at how much I was panicking about which part of the meal I should eat first in the context of digestive health (a mealtime ritual of mine). I decided, \"do the opposite,\" and it scared the **** out of me but I did it, and the world didn\'t end. I started applying that to other things, like eating different foods, asking for random orders, and just basically changing things up to mess with the routine because I realised the world will not end if I\'m not in control of things all the time.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to use your mind to deal with and justify control and the possible loss of control. For example, whenever I get anxious about anything whether it be weight gain or a job interview, I say, \"Liam, what is the very worst that could happen?\" and not caring so much about death, our common worst fear, I discover, the very worst thing that could happen is that I\'ll have to deal with how I feel if [thing] does/doesn\'t happen. Big deal. Of course I\'m scared of my own mind more than anything else, but I can handle it, and so can you. Your mind is so powerful, it got you here and it\'ll get you out of it.\n\nThat said, though, a the****** who specialises in EDs is a great ally, so don\'t resign to doing it all alone.\n\n','2018-11-19 11:35:55',_binary '\0',12,7),(57,'Yes!

A big thing for me was variety. I ate the same thing at the same time for years! Don’t be me. It’s not as fun as I thought it was.\n\nBesides variety I recommend listening to your body. I spent years telling my body what to eat without actually listening to how hungry it was.\n\nAlso therapy!\n\nIt’s gonna take time and you will mess up.

I asked them to let me lay down with cloth over my eyes for a minute or two before sliding me in and not to talk to me the entire time. I recited nursery rhymes and song lyrics in my head the whole time. It was perfect and I barely remember the drive home but hubby said I was talking fine.\n\n','2018-11-19 11:36:52',_binary '\0',13,2),(60,'You should check in to an open MRI facility. The resolution of the open ones is now on par with what you get from the old style tubes. I\'m never climbing in to one of those damn things again. I needed 4 studies (8 if you count with and w/o contrast dye) from brain to butt and all I had to do was sit in a cramped chair watching bad Adam Sandler movies. I dont know if the area they need to scan presents a problem, but I kind of doubt it. This facility does a volume business and it seemed to be the only MRI machine in the joint.\n\nThe ineptitude and lack of care regarding your pain is the new normal, thanks to greedy addiction professionals creating a crisis where none really exists. Dropping the prescribing of pain medication to its lowest level in decades hasn\'t done a thing but leave people in untreated pain. If they could stop the use of heroin, they would see a drop in deaths, but since the only action they can take is restricting legitimate use of pain medication, that\'s what they do. That it is the complete opposite of what they should do, driving people in pain to seek out dangerous alternatives, doesn\'t seem to matter.\n\nI have something for you that I have shared with a lot of people for panic/anxiety attacks like you experienced. It works pretty good for most folks. Its a breathing method called the Relaxation Response. They have a website at www.relaxationresponse.org . It explain how to do it, what it does and how it works. In a nutshell, our bodies are hardwired to respond in certain ways to threat, like pain and fear. It boosts your adrenaline so you can either fight more fiercely or run away from threat as fast as you can. Imagine cavemen hunting prey or being hunted as prey. Its that sort of reaction (called the fight or flight response), which can be an advantage at the right time. It can really screw you up at the wrong time or if you\'re \"adrenaline pump\" gets stuck in the on position. The Relaxation Response is how you turn it off.\n\nI know youre probably rolling your eyes about some BS meditation idea. The RR has a little of the same crap, like imagining your \"happy place\" as you do the exercise. Who\'s got a \"happy place\" when they are freaking out with pain and anxiety? Just put your mind in to some benign thought. I suggest people just count as they inhale and exhale. If your mind jumps from the count to paying this month\'s rent, no big deal, just go back to your counting. Worrying about doing it wrong can be less help than not doing it at all. You can\'t really do it wrong, its breathing.\n\nYou should get this MRI done and have them send you your own copy of the report. Try and understand what they see. The docs are their to give an opinion of a diagnosis. Sometimes they consider something insignificant and it may not be so. You should at least be armed with questions. Not everything the may find will cause pain. Disc bulges and herniations are often harmless if they dont compress a nerve. But they can affect how you sit, stand, and move and it can knock everything above and below out of alignment, causing muscle fatigue and pain. Insignificant is a matter of judgement and the better you understand what creates their opinion, the better off you will be. If you want there folks here that can help explain the results. Just make sure you redact any personal info. Hang in there.\n\n','2018-11-19 11:38:53',_binary '\0',13,3),(61,'Cool, good luck!

His relationship had recently ended when ours had begun (first red flag). I tried to walk away but he was so tenacious, and the fantasy he created in my mind was too difficult to resist. All the right words were said. It felt like he could see into my soul and predict what I would need to hear at any given point. However, people he described as \"just friends\" did not make sense to me, but I continued to ignore my intuition. In April I saw a dating app on his phone. Upon confrontation, I was told it was just for friends prior to us meeting but the messages were all deleted before I could see this to be true. Again, all the right things were said and the fantasy continued. As time went on, more red flags began popping up: a small white lie on a Monday, canceled plans on a Saturday, and soon every day was bombilating with apprehension. Friends began telling me that I was choosing to ignore the signs and that I need to leave. \"Be careful with that one love, he will do what it takes to survive(Hamilton),\" said one friend. Still, I chose to believe in the fantasy. In July, I found him on another dating app and I \"catfished\" him, you could say. He sent a pin drop to his location, provocative messages, and the fantasy felt shattered. Yet again, I did not leave, but I no longer believed his lies. The curse in being a Capricorn is that I hardly ever leave. Once I attach myself to something, I can\'t let go. I won\'t let go. A few months passed and although we had moments of magic, there were more moments of torment than anything. How do you believe anything else? The short answer is, I couldn\'t, yet I still did not leave. By the end of September, he left stating that he had a dream that I would be unable to heal as long as he remained in my life. He tried to wrap his departure like a Christmas gift, martyring himself for the greater good of \"me.\" It\'s been a rough journey of healing, but I can see that now he would not recognize me. This time, I put my pieces back together differently. I could not have gotten by without the support of my friends, and I will try to be here for anyone in need of support that may be going through a similar situation. A brilliant radio show host once said that people can often bleach red flags white in an attempt to keep the fantasy of the relationship alive, and that is exactly what I did.

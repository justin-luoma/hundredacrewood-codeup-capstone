        <blockquote>You say you're depressed - all I see is resilience. You are allowed to feel messed up and inside out. It doesn't mean you're defective, it just means you're human. - David Mitchell</blockquote>

        <blockquote>I wanted a perfect ending. Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. - Gilda Radner</blockquote>

        <blockquote>The truth is: belonging starts with self-acceptance. Your level of belonging, in fact, can never be greater than your level of self-acceptance, because believing that you're enough is what gives you the courage to be authentic, vulnerable, and imperfect. - Brene Brown</blockquote>

        <blockquote>You're looking for the explanation, the loophole, the bright twist in the dark tale that reverses your story's course. But it won't reverse-for me or for you or for anyone who has ever been wronged, which is everyone. Allow your acceptance of the universality of suffering to be a transformative experience. You do that by simply looking at what pains you squarely in the face and then moving on. You don't have to move fast or far. You can go just an inch, you can mark your progress breath by breath. - Cheryl Strayed </blockquote>
